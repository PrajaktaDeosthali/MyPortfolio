This is my resume. HTML5 and CSS3 is used to create this set of 4 webpages. 
The webpages are as follows :
1. Home
2. Education
3. Experience
4. Contact Me

External CSS is used for styling the pages. 
The webpages are compatible on all browsers. 
The pages are resizable and the look and feel remains the same even on small browser windows.

Contact Me page consists of a mailer, where the visitor can send email to me. 
Social networking details are provided in the footer for other ways to contact. 

The webpages are validated using following sites :
1. HTML validation: http://validator.w3.org/
2. CSS validation : http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
